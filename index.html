            <h3>The captain of the Straw Hat Pirates</h3>
            <p>Luffy is the captain of the Straw Hat Pirates and is best friends with all of them and values them over
                all
                else. At first glance, Luffy does not appear to be very intelligent, often seeing things in a childish
                manner and can easily be amazed by the simplest things. However, because he views the world in a
                straightforward and simple manner, he is occasionally the only person who can see past the events and
                see
                what should be done.

                Luffy seems to have an unstoppable appetite, a characteristic that is common to the Japanese archetype
                of
                the (at times simple-minded) young male hero/adventurer with a heart of gold; perhaps the hunger more so
                in
                Luffy's case due to having an elastic stomach. Luffy is also another one of the several characters given
                the
                middle initial "D."

                Although Luffy is fairly lightheaded and a funny character, he has an unstoppable sense of
                determination,
                optimism, and commitment and will do anything to stand up for his friends and comrades. Along with that,
                he
                has great courage to back it up as well as unbelievable strength. Ever since consuming the devil fruit
                he
                was shown to be not worried about his inability to swim, much like his brother. Much of these traits are
                common among D's. His only display of true fear is towards his grandfather, to the point that he is
                intimidated at the mere mention of him.

                Luffy never kills any of his enemies, no matter how cold-hearted they are; instead, he frequently sends
                the
                villain flying, knocking them out or beating them to a point that they are almost near death, which
                results
                in some of the villains searching for revenge, such as Buggy the Clown and Alvida. Oda explains that
                it's
                not a question of morality so much as a matter of punishing the villains for their crimes - he feels
                that
                killing the villains lets them off too lightly, whereas he considers letting them live to see their
                dreams
                be ruined a far more fitting punishment.

                Luffy's dream is to find the One Piece and become Pirate King. He knows that to achieve his goal, he
                will
                have to defeat many strong opponents, including the World Government and his childhood hero Shanks.</p>

            <h3>The vice captain of the Straw Hat Pirates</h3>
            <p>Zoro was the first crew member to be recruited by Luffy. Zoro is a skilled swordsman who fights with his
                own unique sword style known as santoryu (three katana fighting style).This is achieved by using one
                katana in each hand and another in his mouth. He is also seen fighting with only one or two swords. When
                in a serious fight he ties his bandana, normally tied on the arm, on his head.

                Though not a samurai, he appears to maintain a certain degree of bushido, and is frequently mistaken for
                one. Unlike Luffy and most of the other Straw Hat pirates, Zoro has been known to kill his opponents if
                he has to, though never in cold blood.

                Zoro has a stern, serious and distanced personality, but, unlike Robin, he often reacts in a goofy and
                exaggerated comic style due to his gruff, impatient attitude. On the ship, he normally either trains
                with weights or sleeps. The only work he is seen doing regularly is hoisting the anchor using his great
                strength. He also likes sake, almost to the degree that Luffy likes meat, but like Nami, he never gets
                drunk due to his inhumanly-high endurance and tolerance for alcohol. Another notable trait is his lack
                of orientation, as Zoro often gets lost, even in small, familiar spaces or when being led by someone.
                Despite this, he is often the first to sense an enemy or danger, and the first to react. He is often
                displayed being well aware of dangerous situations and people around him.

                Zoro often also reminds others of the harsh facts, which often shocks some of the other crew members,
                although they usually decide he is right. Zoro has also stated that he is an atheist, and has never
                believed in anything except himself. He often comes across as arrogant and overconfident, but only
                because he knows he's a strong man with great fighting ability. Even so, Zoro knows that he still has a
                lot of untapped potential, and is constantly seen training and trying to improve his fighting skills. He
                also adheres to a strict sword master's code of honor, and never falsely brags or lies about his
                abilities, sometimes outright admitting a weakness, even to an enemy. He also never tries to escape from
                a fight or use trickery to win, believing that doing so is cowardly and scorning anyone who uses such
                tactics. Zoro is very vigorous, strong-willed, and determined.</p>
